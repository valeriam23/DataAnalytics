# Chort analysis and RFM segmentation for an e-commerce shop
The goal of this project was to clean the data and answer the following questions:
1. How many users purchased only once?
2. How many orders do not get delivered on average? What are the reasons? Give the detailed information.
3. For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is purchased most often.
4. How many purchases does the shop have by day of week?
5. How many purchases does each user have on average per week (by month)? Considering that there may not be a whole number of weeks within a month.
6. Conduct a cohort analysis of users. Identify the cohort with the highest retention for the 3rd month.
7. Build RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) segmentation of users.
