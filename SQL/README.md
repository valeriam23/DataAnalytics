# Example of a SQL query to calculate product metrics
The workflow in this mini-project is straightforward: connect to the database and calculate the metrics (in one query). The metrics I focused on:
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
* Average Revenue Per Active User (ARPAU)
* Conversion Rate (CR) from user to purchase
* Conversion Rate (CR) from active user to purchase
* Conversion Rate (CR) from activity in Math  (subject = ’math’) to purchase
